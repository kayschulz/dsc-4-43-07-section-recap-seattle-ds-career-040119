    "\n",
    "* CNN are often preferred over densely connected networks when the goal is to perform image classification\n",
    "* Using CNNs instead of densely connected networks can drastically decrease the amount of parameters needed (and as a consequence, increase the speed)\n",
    "* When building a CNN, the end of the network architecture always connects back to a densely connected network to perform classification\n",
    "* At the most basic level, a convolution is particularly good at detecting small image features, such as horizontal or vertical edges\n",
    "* Convolutions use *filter* to detect these small patterns, and these filters are generally of size 3x3 or 5x5.\n",
    "* In CNNs, padding can be used to prevent shrinkage and to make sure pixels at the edge of an image deserve the necessary attention\n",
    "* To understand CNN structures and how the dimensions change in each layer, it is important to understand how filters work and how the number of filters affect the network structure.\n",
    "* When visualizing intermediate layers in a CNN, you noticed that images become more abstract with each layer we add to a CNN"
